## How long have spent time developing this website?

Uncountable. Just on Hackatime it recorded 50 hours and 19 minutes in total.


## Is the API's avaibale to everyone? 
Unfortunately not, this website uses a strict CORS policy that restricts other websites from accessing this website's resources (I mean it would burn though my Vercel free tier).

But you can still host it on your own Vercel / Netlify / Zeabur / your server, and you can set your keys there, in the near future, the database tables, and the .env's will have examples to let you self host it.
